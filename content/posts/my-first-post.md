## **Introduction**  
A simple LED circuit is one of the most basic electronic circuits. It consists of an LED, a resistor, and a power source (battery or adapter). This circuit is great for beginners to learn the basics of electricity and circuits.

## **Components Required**  
| Component  | Specification  | Quantity |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| LED        | 5mm Red/Blue/Green | 1        |
| Resistor   | 220Ω or 330Ω  | 1        |
| Battery    | 9V            | 1        |
| Connecting Wires | -      | As required |
